## Getting Started

First, clone the [spotify graphql server](https://github.com/alis-khadka/spotify-graphql-server) :

required node version: v8.17.0 (I tried to run using latetest version but could not.)

run the graphql server

```bash
npm start
```

Then, run the development server (client-side):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) with your browser to see the result.

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

### Note: Make sure the graphql server is running.
I tried using mocks but it was taking more time to get it right.
